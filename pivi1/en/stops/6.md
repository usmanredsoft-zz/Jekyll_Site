World Record is a new work created for The Bass as part of this exhibit.

Inviting to the imagination, the work is both a minimalist statement and also a sculpture that welcomes you to its core.

The large geometric elements clad in denim point to Donald Judd.
Sounds become muffled, our sensorial experience of the gallery is immediately altered.

As we go deep into its center we begin to crawl in four legs. Our motions confuse us with the bears next door. We have become the animals.
