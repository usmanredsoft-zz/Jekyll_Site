While the artist was living in a tiny island in Italy, she noticed how locals would move around the landscape.

Without roads to connect each end of the island, residents would resort to moving by boat to reach the other side of the mountains.

And that movement also included their animals. So here the artist chose to recreate that very moment where the donkey, still tethered to land, is ready for his trip around the island.
