A taxidermied musk ox is presented with a mountain of coffee beans at his feet.

The ox is an animal that lives in the Alaska region and is still sustainably consumed by the Inuit tribes of North America.

This is a scent sculpture that becomes activated by the surprising aroma of the artist's favorite drink.

As we exit the mattress giant behind it, we can literally wake up and smell the coffee.
