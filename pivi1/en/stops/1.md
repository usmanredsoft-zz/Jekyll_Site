## Welcome to Paola Pivi’s largest US solo show to date at The Bass Museum of Art.

"Art with a View" presents new work by the artist along with previous works, such as her famous feather-covered bears and much more.

The artist’s nomadic life has reached the farthest corners of the earth. Born in Milan but currently living in Alaska, she usually incorporates wildlife in her work in a way that reminds us of our own humanity.
