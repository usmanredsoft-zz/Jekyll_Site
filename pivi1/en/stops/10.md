In this film from 2009, the artist presents us with a performance commissioned for the One Day Sculpture, a New Zealand project where artists were invited to produce a new work that occurred during a 24-hour period.

The goldfish were flown in a commercial airliner for the first part of the day and upon landing at a hangar later on, the audience was invited aboard the plane for a vernissage.

Afterwards, the plane took off once again, flying over the Tasmanian sea, completing the second part of the day.
