In this work, pearls are the medium. Selected to include every possible pearl color produced by an oyster, they are not a sculpture nor a painting, but a hybrid between both.

Also in keeping with the Animal Kingdom, the artist here turns to its byproduct, the cultured pearl.

Individually strung together the work shows an element of craft as well.
