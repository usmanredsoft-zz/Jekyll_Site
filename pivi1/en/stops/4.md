In the context of the wild, this picture presents us with opposites.
Zebras, an animal from the African savannah are here placed out of their element.

The artist staged this shot in a frozen mountaintop just outside Rome.

The playful zebras, with their black and white stripes are let free on the snowy peak.

The blue of the sky and the mountaintops act as background to the otherwise unaware zebras.
