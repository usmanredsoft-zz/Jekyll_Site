Pivi's immersive new work installation surrounds the audience with everyday images in their native form.

Over 40,000 photographs are shown just as they were snapped, without any editing or manipulation.

The images are a stand-in for plain truth, while the phrases relate irrefutable lies.

In this work, the contradictions of the voice-over casts the audience in a search for the truth.
