These collages augment our memory of pop culture. Star Trek characters appear along cereal box cutouts, halloween monsters and prehistoric cartoon characters are brought back to life.

Framing plays a predominant role on each work. The matting is put to work as well as the frame.

The colors are vibrant and seem like they could glow in the dark. The eye travels the entire surface of the paper, mat and frame. We follow the matted contours around seemingly minor details to quickly realize that this is what makes every element in the work equally important.

The practice of collage as part of modern art dates to the cubist movement. The use of popular culture images and Pop icons point to Andy Warhol. And the paper cutouts
relate of course to Matisse.
