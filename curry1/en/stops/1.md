## Welcome to Aaron Curry’s "Tune Yer Head" at The Bass

Arriving in the galleries, we witness the work rise from idea to completion.
This is Art - as process.

From carpet to wallpaper, it is here that the artist’s own sketches share center stage
with the finished work.

The endless lines stand in for the signal - the noise we can tune our heads to.

They belong to our analog world perhaps, the world of Television and Radio of the past.

Some monochrome and some neon, they bear evidence of the artist’s hand.

But unlike Pollock's drip paint, these lines are deliberate and drawn.

The long, broad strokes reach both ends of the carpet while others much thinner and
smaller display his sculptures at different stages of development.
