This camouflage room, monochrome, incomplete and hermetic borrows heavily from
Picassoâ€™s postwar periods as well as Calder.

The room and the wooden sculpture itself both give the feel of a chalkboard.

The sculpture appears different from every angle, balancing in apparent symmetry with
itself as you encircle it.
