This painting forms a sort of intergalactic experience. A nod to Curryâ€™s interest in
outer-space but also to the hashtags of social media, the cyber-space.

In this painting, the black matte finish has no highlights, while the blue airbrushes give it
the 3D effect usually found in urban graffiti.

The contrasting colors and technique provide layered depth to the work.
