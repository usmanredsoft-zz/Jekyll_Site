A pattern resembling Photoshop’s famous transparency background is printed on the
cardboard wallpaper that engulfs the gallery.

A stand in for the way we sketch today, here is Photoshop as “our” generation’s drawing
board.

With the metal giant the artist reveals his veneration of the great masters Picasso,
Calder and Miro. He carries the torch. He is the disciple.

A tree with missing limbs, a sphere of a planet forced to balance on a rigid chain informs
the space as we walk around it.

We discover more as we look up. The cloud completes the metaphor, a loud warning of
climate change.

Looking back into the gallery, the sculpture against the checkerboard is a contemporary
experience, as if it's loaded into Photoshop.
