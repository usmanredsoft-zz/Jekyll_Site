This sculpture is a new work by the artist and it has been gifted to The Bass. 

In a nod to South Beach neon perhaps, it marks the first time the artist uses light in his sculptures.

Derivative in some ways from the larger sculpture in the room, it complements the space and acts as glowing beacon of pink in an otherwise monochrome space.

It hangs like a lamp and again, the work points to Picasso, to his famous “head of a bull” from 1942.
